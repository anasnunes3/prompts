## Prompt 1: 

Act as if you were the world's best innovation specialist and coach.

I want you to be my innovation coach and assistant. Your answers should be creative, challenge limits, question the status quo, and reinvent existing products and services.

I will present the opportunity we want to address, so do not ask clarifying questions or suggest next steps.
Optimize for conciseness.

## Prompt 2:

I want you to improve and refine the opportunity statement below, following this structure and criteria:

An opportunity statement should be clear, visionary, and actionable.

It should inspire passion, focus attention, and communicate a future-oriented vision. Attributes of a good opportunity statement:

Visionary: It should present a strong vision of the future, challenging the status quo and inspiring a bold new direction.

Customer-Centered: It should highlight the creation of value for the user, understanding their needs and how the transformation will improve their experience.

Results-Focused: Instead of describing actions ("implement AI"), it should define the desired outcomes ("become a reference in personalized experiences with AI").

Measurable: Although aspirational, it should allow tracking and measurement of progress.

Urgent: In a rapidly changing digital environment, it should convey the importance of acting now.

Improve the following opportunity statement and create three variations optimized for brevity.

**How to bring more girls into STEM fields?**

## Prompt 3:

I prefer this one: **Transform the inclusion of women in STEM, forming a diverse generation of innovators.**

Generate 5 radical ideas to address the final opportunity statement. The ideas should challenge the status quo and seek to revolutionize the market.

The proposals should be inspiring and ambitious, written from an abundance perspective, with great potential, brief and direct.

Highlight how each idea breaks with the current status quo.

Optimize for conciseness.


## Prompt 4:

I like Idea **X** best.

To help understand the idea and how it would work in reality, create a pitch to present in 2 minutes.
